    <strong>Abstract.</strong>
    In this invited talk I focus on the difficulties of maintaining and evolving software systems that are part of a larger ecosystem. While not every software system falls under this category, software ecosystems are becoming ubiquitous due to the omnipresence of open source software. I present several challenges that arise during maintenance and evolution of software ecosystems, and I argue how some of these challenges should be addressed by adopting a socio-technical view and by relying on a multidisciplinary and mixed methods research approach.
