<h2>NSF Student Travel Funding</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
ICSME 2016 is happy to announce that travel grants for US-based students are available for students interested in attending ICSME 2016 or one of the collocated events. The grants are sponsored by the <a href="http://nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation (NSF)</a>.
</p>

<h3>Eligibility Criteria</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
All students (graduate or undergraduate) enrolled at US-based universities and institutions are eligible to apply; however, priority will be given to students presenting papers at ICSME 2016 in any of the conference tracks or at collocated events. All students, including non‐U.S. citizens, are eligible to apply, though priority will be given to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. We particularly encourage students from underrepresented groups to apply.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
At the end of the conference, the students who have been selected to receive travel supplements from this NSF grant are requested to provide a one‐page report on their research experiences and impressions of ICSME 2016. The reimbursement will be sent to the student upon the receipt of a one‐page experience report.
